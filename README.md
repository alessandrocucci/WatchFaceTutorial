# Android Wear Watchface using Image Bitmaps

This is a simple project to display an Android Wear analog watchface using only bitmaps instead of canvas drawLine functions to display hands. So, you can use this project to simply create new Android Watchfaces in seconds, changing only the background, hour, minute and second PNG files. 

Note that for this project I used the official Android Wear API.

> If youâ€™ve already built a watch face for Android Wear using an unofficial approach, you should migrate your apps to the official API. The official API ensures a consistent user experience across the platform, while giving you additional information and controls, such as letting you know when the watch enters ambient mode, allowing you to adjust the position of system UI elements, and more. Using the new API is also necessary for your app to be featured in the Watch Faces collection on Google Play.
